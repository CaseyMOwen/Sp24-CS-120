# Sp24-CS-120

Work done for Tufts University's CS120 Web Programming and Engineering class in Spring 2024. 

As part of this graduate-level class I learned valuable skills useful in web programming and interacting with the web. I used a wide variety of tools and technologies in this class:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- MySQL
- PHP
- MongoDB
- Node.js

The projects listed below, with the source code in the repository, represent the most significant assignments completed during the semester. The projects chronicle my abilities increasing over time as the projects get increasingly complex. 

## Project 1
https://caseyowen.com/cs120/Project1/
### Assignment
Independently create a small website for a cover band. Must have at least 4 pages, and contain realistic content.

## Project 2
https://caseyowen.com/cs120/Project2/

## Project 3

### Assignment
Independently create an interactive e-commerce website, using interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with MySQL database and PHP.

## Final Project
https://caseyowen.com/cs120/FinalProject/swaparoo/
### Assignment
In a group of 3 students, create a useful web app that performs a useful task that uses all previous elements learned in class - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and an API call.

### Result
We chose to create a website that facilitates swapping used books. This allows customers to recoup value of their old books, and prevent in-demand books from sitting on owner's bookshelves, unused.

Our site, ***Swap-a-Roo***, would allow users to trade in a site currency (credits) to buy and sell used books, owned by other users. You can browse the storefront, list books, and query the Google Books API in order to search for custom books from your bookshelf to post as available for other users.
